    - 5 mod 0 ≡ ⊥
    ⊥ is called bottoms, undefined or ... exception

    - A funciton that is defined to be ⊥ is any of its arguments
    is ⊥, is called a strict funciton

    - λ-calculus.
        -> not the best syntax - not importnat
        -> no "data structures" - functions are all you need
        -> no need for named functions
        -> no defined evaluation order

    - functional programming languages:
        -> different syntax, some good, some strange
        -> almost always provide built-in or user defined data structures
        -> named function i.e. the program
        -> defines the evaluation order

    - all functional programming languages have a core that can be expressed in λ-calculus
